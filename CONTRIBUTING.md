1. Adhere to template (will be enforced soon)
    - Each category should consist of content labelled in the following order
        1. Popular Tools
            - Organised by subcategory with subpoints
            - Use cases for each tool should be clearly described
        2. Technical Concepts
            - Examples should be linked to a seperate file in the same folder
            - Explainations should be kept simple
        3. External Resources
            - Self-promotion is allowed, to a certain extend
2. Commits
    - Commits should state clearly what was added
    - Example "added \[tool\], \[short description of tool\]"
