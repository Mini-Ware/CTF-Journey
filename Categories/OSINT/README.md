# Cheatsheet
when given USERNAME, run through sherlock/google to find websites where the username turns up. consider `inurl:`

when given EMAIL, <br>
  consider sending an email to the address (with throwaway email) because there might be an automated reply (thanks josh) <br>
  consider running it through a reverse email checker (I haven't found one that works) or obtaining the GAIA ID to check for google activity <br>
